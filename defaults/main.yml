# The list of admin users to add on every machine.
# Every user must have a name and a key.
#
# Keys can be specified as strings, URLs or local files.
# - To specify a key directly, just provide the key as string.
# - To load a key from file, prefix the path with the `file:` schema.
# - To load a key from a URL, specify a URL with `http:` or `https:` schema.
#
# The list is flattened automatically to allow for something like:
# admins:
#   - *global_admins
#   - name: additional_admin
#     key: ...
admins: []

# If users not listed as admins should be deleted.
# The script uses home directories to identify existing users.
